Players may need to investigate crime scenes, find evidence, and identify the murderer. Puzzle: Emphasize problem-solving and logic. Players encounter a series of puzzles or challenges that they must solve to progress through the game. Treasure Hunting: Involves searching for hidden treasures. Players explore diverse environments, decipher clues, and overcome obstacles to discover valuable items or locations. Escape: Focus on the player's ability to escape from confined spaces or situations. Players must explore their surroundings, find clues, and solve puzzles to find a way out.
