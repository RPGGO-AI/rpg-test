I think the best category for the RPG game based on the customer's request would be the Detective category. It aligns perfectly with the customer's desire to play as a detective and collaborate with Conan to solve a case. This category will allow players to analyze evidence, interrogate suspects, and follow leads to uncover the truth, just like in the Detective Conan series.

I agree with you. The Detective category is the most suitable choice for the RPG game based on the customer's request. It will provide an immersive experience for players to step into the shoes of a detective and work alongside Conan to solve a case. This category will allow us to incorporate elements such as analyzing evidence, interrogating suspects, and following leads, which are essential to the detective genre.
