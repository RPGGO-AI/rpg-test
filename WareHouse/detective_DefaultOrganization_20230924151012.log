**Suspect File: suspect.py**

```python

This file contains the Suspect class, which represents a suspect in the murder case.

'''

class Suspect:

        self.occupation = occupation
```

In this design, the main file `main.py` creates the main game window using the tkinter GUI framework. It then creates a `GameScene` object and starts the game by calling the `start_game` method.

The `GameScene` class in the `game_scene.py` file represents the main gameplay scene. It displays the game introduction and a button to start the investigation. When the button is clicked, it hides the button, creates an `InvestigationScene` object, and starts the investigation by calling the `start_investigation` method.

The `InvestigationScene` class in the `investigation_scene.py` file represents the scene where the player investigates the murder case. It displays the investigation scene and creates buttons for each suspect. When a suspect button is clicked, it hides the buttons, displays the suspect's information, and continues the investigation.

The `Suspect` class in the `suspect.py` file represents a suspect in the murder case. It has attributes for the suspect's name and occupation.

This design provides a basic structure for the Sherlock Holmes RPG game, allowing the player to investigate the murder case by interrogating suspects. You can further expand on this design by adding more scenes, puzzles, and interactions to create a more immersive gameplay experience.

In this design, the main file `main.py` creates the main game window using the tkinter GUI framework. It then creates a `GameScene` object and starts the game by calling the `start_game` method.

The `GameScene` class in the `game_scene.py` file represents the main gameplay scene. It displays the game introduction and a button to start the investigation. When the button is clicked, it hides the button, creates an `InvestigationScene` object, and starts the investigation by calling the `start_investigation` method.

The `InvestigationScene` class in the `investigation_scene.py` file represents the scene where the player investigates the murder case. It displays the investigation scene and creates buttons for each suspect. When a suspect button is clicked, it hides the buttons, displays the suspect's information, and continues the investigation.

The `Suspect` class in the `suspect.py` file represents a suspect in the murder case. It has attributes for the suspect's name and occupation.

This design provides a basic structure for the Sherlock Holmes RPG game, allowing the player to investigate the murder case by interrogating suspects. You can further expand on this design by adding more scenes, puzzles, and interactions to create a more immersive gameplay experience.
