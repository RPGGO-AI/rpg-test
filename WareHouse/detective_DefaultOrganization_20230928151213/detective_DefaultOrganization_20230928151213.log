I think for this particular task, the best category for the RPG game would be "Detective". It aligns perfectly with the customer's request of playing as Sherlock Holmes and solving a case. The detective category allows players to investigate, analyze evidence, and make deductions, which are all essential elements of a Sherlock Holmes-style game.

I agree with you. The "Detective" category would be the most suitable choice for this task. It provides the perfect framework for players to step into the shoes of Sherlock Holmes and engage in a thrilling investigation. This category will allow us to incorporate elements such as analyzing clues, interrogating suspects, and ultimately solving the case. It will provide an immersive and engaging experience for the player, fulfilling the customer's request.
