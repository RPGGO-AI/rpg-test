I think the best category for this RPG game would be Mystery. It aligns perfectly with the customer's request to play as Sherlock Holmes and solve puzzles or unravel unknown events. The player can gather clues, interview characters, and make deductions to solve the mystery alongside a child companion. This category would provide an engaging and immersive experience for the player.
