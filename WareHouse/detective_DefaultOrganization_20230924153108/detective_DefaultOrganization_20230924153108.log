I suggest we consider creating the RPG game as a mobile app. This will allow the user to easily access and play the game on their smartphones or tablets. It will also provide a more immersive and interactive experience for the user. Additionally, a mobile app can leverage the device's capabilities such as touch controls and push notifications to enhance the gameplay. What do you think?

As the Game Reviewer, to make the game directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all scene should have a goal
2) all scene should have characters, and new character should have background desscription
3) all scene should have background story;
4) no potential logical bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the scene, but also the logic of scene. Make sure that user can interact with generated rpg scene without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the scenes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the scenes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the scenes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: design a rpg game for me. I want to play the role as Sherlock Holmes and investigate a murder case.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The scenes provided in the code are missing the necessary implementation of game logic, rendering, and interaction. Additionally, there is no clear goal defined for each scene. To fix this, you need to revise the code and add the missing functionality to ensure that the game is playable and meets the user's requirements.

Here are the instructions on how to fix the scenes:

1) In the `game_scene.py` file:
- Add necessary game objects and initialize the game state in the `__init__` method.
- Implement the game logic and update the game state in the `update` method.
- Implement rendering of the game scene in the `render` method.
- Define a clear goal for the game scene, such as finding clues or interrogating suspects.

2) In the `character.py` file:
- Implement the character interaction logic in the `interact` method.
- Implement the character movement logic in the `move` method.
- Add background descriptions for each character to provide more context for the players.

3) In the `prop.py` file:
- Implement the prop interaction logic in the `interact` method.
- Implement the prop movement logic in the `move` method.

4) In the `scene.py` file:
- Implement the scene entry logic in the `enter` method.
- Implement the scene exit logic in the `exit` method.
- Implement the scene interaction logic in the `interact` method.
- Define a clear goal for each scene, such as searching for evidence or interviewing witnesses.

5) In the `murder_case.py` file:
- Implement the murder case investigation logic in the `investigate` method.
- Implement the suspect accusation logic in the `accuse` method.
- Implement the murder case solving logic in the `solve` method.

Once you have made the necessary revisions to the code, make sure to test the game thoroughly to ensure that all scenes are functioning correctly and that the game meets the user's requirements.

Here are the instructions on how to fix the scenes:

1) In the `game_scene.py` file:
- Add necessary game objects and initialize the game state in the `__init__` method.
- Implement the game logic and update the game state in the `update` method.
- Implement rendering of the game scene in the `render` method.
- Define a clear goal for the game scene, such as finding clues or interrogating suspects.

2) In the `character.py` file:
- Implement the character interaction logic in the `interact` method.
- Implement the character movement logic in the `move` method.
- Add background descriptions for each character to provide more context for the players.

3) In the `prop.py` file:
- Implement the prop interaction logic in the `interact` method.
- Implement the prop movement logic in the `move` method.

4) In the `scene.py` file:
- Implement the scene entry logic in the `enter` method.
- Implement the scene exit logic in the `exit` method.
- Implement the scene interaction logic in the `interact` method.
- Define a clear goal for each scene, such as searching for evidence or interviewing witnesses.

5) In the `murder_case.py` file:
- Implement the murder case investigation logic in the `investigate` method.
- Implement the suspect accusation logic in the `accuse` method.
- Implement the murder case solving logic in the `solve` method.

Once you have made the necessary revisions to the code, make sure to test the game thoroughly to ensure that all scenes are functioning correctly and that the game meets the user's requirements.

As the Game Reviewer, to make the game directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all scene should have a goal
2) all scene should have characters, and new character should have background desscription
3) all scene should have background story;
4) no potential logical bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the scene, but also the logic of scene. Make sure that user can interact with generated rpg scene without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the scenes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the scenes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the scenes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The scenes provided are missing the necessary implementation of game logic and interaction. The current code structure only contains placeholder functions that need to be filled in. To make the game playable and interactive, the following revisions are needed:

1) In the `GameScene` class in `game_scene.py`, implement the game logic and update the game state in the `update` function. This function should handle player input, character movement, and interaction with props and scenes.

2) In the `GameScene` class in `game_scene.py`, implement the rendering of the game scene in the `render` function. This function should display the current scene, characters, and props to the player.

3) In the `Character` class in `character.py`, implement the logic for character interaction in the `interact` function. This function should handle dialogue, item exchange, or any other interaction between the player and characters.

4) In the `Prop` class in `prop.py`, implement the logic for prop interaction in the `interact` function. This function should handle any interaction between the player and props, such as picking up items or solving puzzles.

5) In the `Scene` class in `scene.py`, implement the logic for scene interaction in the `interact` function. This function should handle any interaction between the player and scenes, such as examining clues or triggering events.

6) In the `MurderCase` class in `murder_case.py`, implement the logic for the murder case investigation, accusation, and solving in the respective functions. These functions should handle gathering evidence, questioning suspects, and ultimately identifying the murderer.

Once these revisions are made, the game will be playable and allow the player to take on the role of Sherlock Holmes, investigate the murder case, interact with characters and props, and progress through the game by solving the mystery.

Please make the necessary revisions to the code to implement the required game logic and interaction.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The scenes provided are missing the necessary implementation of game logic and interaction. The current code structure only contains placeholder functions that need to be filled in. To make the game playable and interactive, the following revisions are needed:

1) In the `GameScene` class in `game_scene.py`, implement the game logic and update the game state in the `update` function. This function should handle player input, character movement, and interaction with props and scenes.

2) In the `GameScene` class in `game_scene.py`, implement the rendering of the game scene in the `render` function. This function should display the current scene, characters, and props to the player.

3) In the `Character` class in `character.py`, implement the logic for character interaction in the `interact` function. This function should handle dialogue, item exchange, or any other interaction between the player and characters.

4) In the `Prop` class in `prop.py`, implement the logic for prop interaction in the `interact` function. This function should handle any interaction between the player and props, such as picking up items or solving puzzles.

5) In the `Scene` class in `scene.py`, implement the logic for scene interaction in the `interact` function. This function should handle any interaction between the player and scenes, such as examining clues or triggering events.

6) In the `MurderCase` class in `murder_case.py`, implement the logic for the murder case investigation, accusation, and solving in the respective functions. These functions should handle gathering evidence, questioning suspects, and ultimately identifying the murderer.

Once these revisions are made, the game will be playable and allow the player to take on the role of Sherlock Holmes, investigate the murder case, interact with characters and props, and progress through the game by solving the mystery.

Please make the necessary revisions to the code to implement the required game logic and interaction."
In the game, each file must strictly follow a markdown block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source that is used to document a specific segment of scene, and "SCENE" is the original designed game script. Format:

As the Game Scene Writer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the game creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding scenes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete scenes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all scenes strictly following the required format.

As the Game Reviewer, to make the game directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all scene should have a goal
2) all scene should have characters, and new character should have background desscription
3) all scene should have background story;
4) no potential logical bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the scene, but also the logic of scene. Make sure that user can interact with generated rpg scene without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the scenes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the scenes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the scenes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

You can write/create rpg game by providing a detailed script for the scene. You have extensive game design and background writing experience in many varieties of RPG games, such as trpg, crpg, jrpg, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: design a rpg game for me. I want to play the role as Sherlock Holmes and investigate a murder case.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The scenes provided in the code are missing some important elements and do not fully meet the requirements of the user. Here are the revisions that need to be made:

1) All scenes should have a goal:
   - Add a goal attribute to the Scene class in scene.py. This attribute should represent the objective or task that the player needs to accomplish in the scene.

2) All scenes should have characters, and new characters should have background descriptions:
   - Add a characters attribute to the Scene class in scene.py. This attribute should be a list of Character objects representing the characters present in the scene.
   - Update the Character class in character.py to include a background_description attribute. This attribute should provide a background description of the character.

3) All scenes should have a background story:
   - Add a background_story attribute to the Scene class in scene.py. This attribute should contain a description of the background story or context for the scene.

4) No potential logical bugs:
   - Review the implementation of the update() and render() methods in the GameScene class in game_scene.py to ensure that they are correctly updating and rendering the game state.

5) The entire project should conform to the tasks proposed by the user:
   - Review all the classes and methods in the code to ensure that they align with the requirements of the user, such as the ability to investigate the murder case as Sherlock Holmes.

Once these revisions are made, the scenes should be more complete and aligned with the user's requirements.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The scenes provided in the code are missing some important elements and do not fully meet the requirements of the user. Here are the revisions that need to be made:

1) All scenes should have a goal:
   - Add a goal attribute to the Scene class in scene.py. This attribute should represent the objective or task that the player needs to accomplish in the scene.

2) All scenes should have characters, and new characters should have background descriptions:
   - Add a characters attribute to the Scene class in scene.py. This attribute should be a list of Character objects representing the characters present in the scene.
   - Update the Character class in character.py to include a background_description attribute. This attribute should provide a background description of the character.

3) All scenes should have a background story:
   - Add a background_story attribute to the Scene class in scene.py. This attribute should contain a description of the background story or context for the scene.

4) No potential logical bugs:
   - Review the implementation of the update() and render() methods in the GameScene class in game_scene.py to ensure that they are correctly updating and rendering the game state.

5) The entire project should conform to the tasks proposed by the user:
   - Review all the classes and methods in the code to ensure that they align with the requirements of the user, such as the ability to investigate the murder case as Sherlock Holmes.

Once these revisions are made, the scenes should be more complete and aligned with the user's requirements."
In the game, each file must strictly follow a markdown block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source that is used to document a specific segment of scene, and "SCENE" is the original designed game script. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
SCENE
```
As the Game Scene Writer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the game creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding scenes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete scenes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all scenes strictly following the required format.
