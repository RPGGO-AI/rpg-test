I think the best category for the RPG game would be Mystery. It aligns perfectly with the customer's request to play as Sherlock Holmes and solve puzzles. The mystery genre will allow players to gather clues, interview characters, and make deductions, just like the famous detective. It will provide an immersive experience and keep players engaged throughout the game.
