I suggest we consider developing the RPG game as a mobile application. This would allow for an immersive and interactive experience for the user, with the ability to easily navigate through the game and engage with the Sherlock Holmes investigation. Additionally, a mobile app would provide the opportunity to incorporate features such as puzzles, clues, and mini-games to enhance the gameplay.

I understand your suggestion to develop the RPG game as a mobile application. This would indeed provide a highly immersive and interactive experience for the user, allowing them to navigate through the game and engage with the Sherlock Holmes investigation. The inclusion of features like puzzles, clues, and mini-games would further enhance the gameplay and make it more enjoyable for the players.

However, before we finalize the decision, let's consider other factors as well. Developing a mobile application requires expertise in mobile app development, and it may involve additional costs and resources. We should also consider the target audience and their preferences. If our target audience primarily uses mobile devices and enjoys gaming on the go, then a mobile app would be a suitable choice.

To gather more information and make an informed decision, I suggest conducting market research and analyzing the preferences of our target audience. This will help us determine if a mobile app is the best modality for our RPG game.

I agree with your points. Conducting market research and analyzing the preferences of our target audience will provide valuable insights in making an informed decision. It will help us understand if a mobile app aligns with the preferences and habits of our target audience. This will ensure that we choose the most suitable modality for our RPG game.

This is the initial design for the RPG game "Sherlock Holmes: Murder Investigation". The game consists of three scenes: the crime scene, the interrogation scene, and the evidence scene. Each scene is represented by a separate class in the `game_scene.py` file.

In the `main.py` file, the game window is created using the tkinter module. The `GameScene` class manages the loading and switching of scenes. The initial scene loaded is the crime scene, where the player investigates the crime scene and finds a torn piece of paper. The player then proceeds to the interrogation scene, where they interrogate a suspect. Finally, the player moves to the evidence scene, where they examine the torn piece of paper and discover an address leading to a suspicious warehouse.

The game scenes are implemented as tkinter frames, with appropriate labels and buttons for interaction. Each scene has a method to handle the player's actions and transition to the next scene.

This design provides a basic structure for the game, and you can further expand upon it by adding more scenes, puzzles, and interactions to create a compelling murder investigation experience as Sherlock Holmes.
