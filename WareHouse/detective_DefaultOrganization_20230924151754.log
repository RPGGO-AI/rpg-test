I suggest we consider developing the game as a mobile application. This would allow for an immersive and interactive experience, with the ability to incorporate various game mechanics and features specific to mobile devices. Additionally, a mobile app would provide the flexibility for players to easily access and play the game on the go.

I understand your suggestion to develop the game as a mobile application. It indeed offers several advantages such as an immersive experience, interactive gameplay, and the ability to leverage mobile-specific features. However, we should also consider other factors such as development costs, target audience, and platform compatibility.

To make an informed decision, I propose conducting market research to identify the preferences and behaviors of our target audience. This will help us determine if a mobile application is the most suitable platform for our Sherlock Holmes RPG game. Additionally, we should also evaluate the feasibility and resources required for mobile app development.

Once we have gathered the necessary information, we can analyze the data and make a well-informed decision. Let's proceed with the market research and discuss the findings before finalizing the product modality.
